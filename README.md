**install numpy package**

(please keep in mind only to follow the tutorial up to installing numbly package)

**Installing opencv**

**install argparse packages**

It is similar to above two steps. You just only have to search for the name  “argparse” then install it

NOW YOU ARE ALL SET UP!

Go to the file directory (to pig or cow folder where you download it). And go to the address bar and type “cmd” then the cmd prompt window will be open.

Then type this:

**python test.py –n cow.jpg**

(cow.jpg means the image you want to test)

<![if !supportLists]>1. <![endif]>Python Test code.

There are two separate test codes for cow and pig. You need to run these python test code with the image name you need to test.

**Eg: python test.py –n cow.jpg**

**Requirements to run the code**

To run the models. Need to install python and python opencv library.Test codes are run in terminal. If you have anaconda or some python IDE you can comment the “argparse” section and uncommenting “image_name” section insert the name of the image there. And then run.

Sample Test results.

Checkout "Another README" to see example result images of cows and pigs.



## Email me for a dataset or find one online.

Test accuracy is shown when an image is tested. For example you can see the below terminal image. Ther are number infront of each detection. So those are the prediction accuracy.

EX: ear type

(‘eyer down’ , 0.9993)

So her the accuracy of showing year down is 99.93%

So this is a good accuracy. And almost every test has a good accuracy. (this accuracy means the how much that the model sure that the prediction is correct)
